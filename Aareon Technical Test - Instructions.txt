Aareon Technical Test - Ticketing System

We need you to extend the current ticketing system that will allow additional resources to be included.

1. Implement RESTful endpoint(s) that will allow all Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) actions on a Ticket.
2. Now amend the solution to allow the addition of Notes to a Ticket.
3. Amend the solution to track any data manipulation and actions. Auditing could happen out of process.
4. Create a Pull Request on github.

Requirements:
- A note is created by a Person to log additional information against a ticket.
- A note can be created, updated, or removed by anyone, but only an Administrator may delete an existing note.
- Any actions that are taken against records in the ticketing system are subject to monitoring and auditing.
- This application will be deployed automatically using a CI/CD pipeline.

These tasks should take no longer than 4 hours
